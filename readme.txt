Clears Elementor element cache meta when specific widgets are detected on a page or post.

== Description ==

Widget Cache Cleaner for Elementor automatically clears the `_elementor_element_cache` meta for posts or pages built with Elementor when certain widgets are present. This helps ensure dynamic widgets like Gravity Forms or custom shortcodes always display up-to-date content.

* Only runs if Elementor is installed and active.
* Detects widgets by type (`pp-gravity-forms`, `shortcode` by default).
* Developers can filter the widget types using the `wccfe_widget_types_to_find` filter.
* No settings page - just activate and go.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to `/wp-content/plugins/` or install via the WordPress admin.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Make sure [Elementor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/elementor/) is installed and active.
